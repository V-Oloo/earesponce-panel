                                            Points are not awarded for the below scenarios:

                                            •	Screen outs- Surveys have a respondent qualification criterion of which is normally determined by the first few questions you respond to. If you are disqualified at this stage, you will not be awarded. We however will try as much as possible to send to you surveys that we feel you qualify for to avoid these cases.
                                            <br/>
                                            •	Straight lining- When your responses are predictable to a point that we can tell you are not reading the questions properly; you will not be awarded even if you get to the end of the survey. Your interview will be terminated and you will be informed as this undermines data quality. In the long run if this is repeated, you will be expelled from our panel for good.
                                            <br/>
                                            •	Speeding- Points are not awarded for respondents who speed through a survey. We encourage you to take your time and read through the questions to get a proper understanding so as to provide the required responses. Like straight-lining, the interview is deleted even if you get to the end and you will receive a warning. If this persists you are expelled from the panel as well.
                                            <br/>
                                            •	Double participation- You can only participate once in a survey, attempts to participate multiple times will lead to an automatic disqualification.
